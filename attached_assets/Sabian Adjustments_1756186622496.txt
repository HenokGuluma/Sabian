These are the modifications I want you to do for me: 


* Change the white fonts in the login and Signup pages that are appearing in a light background to black font, so that there is a better contrast. (For example: ‘Join Sabian’ and ‘Full Name’ texts in the Sign up page).
* Add the credentials email: henimagne@gmail.com and password: tdashuluqa as valid credentials and sign me into the console. Any other credential should be rejected as invalid username and password.
* Add a realistic sign in flow when I input the above credentials and mimic loading data on console dashboard to make it appear like there is real data pulling happening.
* Add about 16,000 records of user data that contains fields username, email address, phone number that starts with +251-9 (for e.g +251945710635), bio, total gems, last active, trending score, purchase history, total games played, total games won and stuff. And make this database accessible and editable as well. 
* Make the total players number 17, 278 on the console dashboard and remove the revenue display. 
* Add a 7 months long record of activity that can be seen in the analytics section. I want the data to show slow beginnings around February upto April and on May a huge bump up that keeps on increasing until August. And I want this to be seen very clearly on the graph. 
* Make the player retention graph increasing over time instead of decreasing.
* Enable the rest of the database tables (player_stats, game sessions etc) and give them realistic datapoints that are also accessible and editable. 
* Fix the appearance of Text Editors and their labels in the LiveOps and Settings view. (e.g Event Name and Enter event name label in LiveOps view). It just needs some proper margins between the editor and label.
